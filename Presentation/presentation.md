# Audio encoding

It has the following parameters:

- Channel.
- Sampling.
- Digital resolution.
- Bit rate.
- Lossy compression.

# Audio formats

- Note that audio format is not equivalent to audio encoding.
- Defines the format of the header of an audio file.
- Don't assume a kind of file has any particular encoding until you inspect its header.
- However, there is a 'formart' like `FLAC` which is both a file format and an encoding.
